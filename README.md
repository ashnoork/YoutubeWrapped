## Getting Started
Frontend (User App):
1. Download the app for your OS:
2. macOS: [YouTubeWrapped.dmg](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LbUhOJJf5Gn5lI5f0qwL5Fc2cLkhI5mJ/view) <= install this 
3. Install it like any normal app (would need to bypass security). 
4. On first launch, sign in and upload your YouTube data to start generating your dashboard.
Backend is deployed, so you don't have to do anything
